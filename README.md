# PowerAutomateAssistant

This project is for building plugins to support and overcome some current deficiencies in Power Automate.

The only current feature is TrueFieldChange, which allows you to identify in a flow which field(s) initiated the change, and also indicate if the value needed to truly change or not. Check out the documentation in the Wiki.
